### R scripts, graphs/plots, and data from my blog, "Just A Data Geek"

* Date Created: 06 August 2015
* Date Updated: 12 August 2015

This is where I will be posting my R scripts, ~~graphs~~, and data used for my blog posts.  The naming convention is explained below.

* R scripts will be named sequentially.  Ex.: `blog#script.R`
* Data will be in `.csv` format.
      * Blog #1 uses:
            - `pricedata.csv`
            - `gasprice.csv`
      * Blog #2 uses:
            - `gc10yrbond.csv`
* ~~Graphs will be in `.png` format named sequentially by post and order `blog#plot#.png`~~

I tried setting up submodules for each blog post but that didn't work well.  Each time I would add a new one, the previous one would become grayed out and inaccessible.  So, for the time being, I am only including my R scripts and the data I used.  
I'll just keep things organized through the repository `README.md` file until I can figure out what I am doing wrong with the submodule option in GitHub.
Thanks for bearing with me.
