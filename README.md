### R scripts, graphs/plots, and data from my blog, "Just A Data Geek"

* Date Created: 06 Aug 2015

This is where I will be posting my R scripts and data used for my blog posts.  The naming convention is explained below.

* R scripts will be named sequentially.  Ex.: `blog#script.R`
* Data will be in `.csv` format.
      * Blog #1 (Gasoline Prices & Quantities) uses:
            `pricedata.csv`,
            `gasprice.csv`
      * Blog #2 (Greek 10-year Bond Rates) uses:
            `gc10yrbond.csv`
      * Blog #3 (Using `knitr()` function) uses:
            No script availble.
      * Blog #4 (Alcoa Stock Price & LME Aluminum Prices & Quantities) uses:
            Data from [Quandl](http://www. quandl.com), as noted in the R script.
      * Blogs #5 and #6 (the "Thesis Research" posts) use:
            `thesisdata_old.csv`,
            `variables_old.csv`,
            `thesisdata_old.R`
            
I tried setting up submodules for each blog post but that didn't work well.  Each time I would add a new one, the previous one would become grayed out and inaccessible.  So, for the time being, I am only including my R scripts and the data I used.  

I'll just keep things organized through the repository `README.md` file until I can figure out what I am doing wrong with the submodule option in GitHub.

Thanks for bearing with me.
